Being originally a task during my work as a HiWi for TUM: Junge Akademie, I am responsible for developing both the frontend web application as well as the code on an AWS server that is capable to do a wide range of common tasks, such as email verification, account creation and interacting with other entities, search function and password reset etc. Source code can be found at: https://github.com/travistang/SciCom"

This is my first attempt to systematically keep track on where my money has gone, and to ultimately predict my account balance with current trend or some hypothetical changes in habits."

      "cvSynopsis": "Neural Turing Machine implementation with Keras Backend",
      "synopsis": "This is the project my friend and I worked on for the course Introduction to Deep Learning (IN2346) at TUM.In this project we compare the performance of 3 different neural networks on learning to play Atari games (Breakout),namely, a simple CNN, RNN (LSTM) and the Neural Turing Machine.Our finding is that the simple CNN performs the best (by that I mean it gives the highest score given the same amount of time of training)and one of the explanations is that the other two networks contain much more parameters that they take more time and 'experiences' to learn.This project also features an implementation of NTM with Keras backend from scratch. Which is, for me,a very good practice for building computational graph."
