{"data":{"content":{"intro":{"about":["I am Travis, a 26-year-old guy from Hong Kong. Currently I am doing my Master's degree in Informatics at Technical University of Munich and am writing my thesis.","I have a wide range of interest. From web development to mobile application development, machine learning (deep learning in particular), networking, IoT (such as with Raspberry Pi, Arduino, ESP8266...), modeling and simulation, quadcopters... These are all in which I have motivation to learn and work on. My goal is to combine the best out of these fields into a few projects, that people can get the most out of it."]}}}}
