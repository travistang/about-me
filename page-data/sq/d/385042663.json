Being originally a task during my work as a HiWi for TUM: Junge Akademie, I am responsible for developing both the frontend web application as well as the code on an AWS server that is capable to do a wide range of common tasks, such as email verification, account creation and interacting with other entities, search function and password reset etc. Source code can be found at: https://github.com/travistang/SciCom","tech":["React","MongoDB","Nodemailer","express.js","docker","AWS"],"url":"https://www.sci-com.org"},{"date":"Mar 2019","name":"Inventory","onGoing":true,"synopsis":"An app that tracks surplus of your accounts (different currencies, cash or in bank), what and how much you have bought and how much of them are left.

Which is, for me,a very good practice for building computational graph.","tech":["Keras","OpenAI Gym"],"url":"https://github.com/travistang/IN2346-Porject"},{"date":"Aug 2018","name":"Personal Website","onGoing":false,"synopsis":"The website I use to present myself.","tech":["React","React-scroll","React-reveal"],"url":"https://travistang.github.io/about/"},{"date":"Jul 2018","name":"MVGDashboard","onGoing":true,"synopsis":"An electron application that displays the departure time and time to destination from your location(I bet MVV and MVG won't like it...).This is planned to be run on a Raspberry Pi and put in a common kitchen so every flatmates of mine can make use of it.I plan to integrate other features to make it even more personalized.Details are unfortunately a secret for now,but you will definitely see in the future.","tech":["Electron","React","Redux","Redux-Saga","Cheerio"],"url":"https://github.com/travistang/MVGDashboard"},{"date":"Sep 2017","name":"wg-crawler","onGoing":false,"synopsis":"A web scraper that periodically visit some housing ads websites,get new offers and send a user-defined email to the landlord.Motivation of this project definitely comes from the difficult housing situation in Munich.I spent a few days to build this crawler immediately after I arrived at the city.Afterwards I use it to contact landlords and improve it meanwhile.Some time later I indeed got an offer from it, which turns out to be where I am living at now.","tech":["Scrapy","Crontab","Parse"],"url":"https://github.com/travistang/wg-crawler"},{"date":"Mar 2018","name":"YoutubeDownloader","onGoing":true,"synopsis":"Another piece of work that challenges the TOS  It is used to coorperate with a Node-based backend to download video (more precisely, audios from YouTube to your mobile devices for playing offline.
